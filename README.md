# Cross-Platform Emotion Classification for Enhanced Mental Health Prediction

Social media platforms have become vital spaces for mental health discussions because they offer users avenues to express emotions and seek support. However, there is a dearth of research in extant literature focused on exploring whether it is possible to classify 
emotions across different platforms, despite the potential for improving mental health 
prediction models. In order to address the gap, this study aims to examine how cross platform emotion classification can help to understand mental health discussions and contribute to the prediction of mental illnesses. 

Mental health-related data was collected from Twitter and Reddit, two of the major social 
websites where people frequently post about their experiences and express their emotions. The data was preprocessed using natural language processing techniques, and then labelled with six emotions using pre-trained models from Hugging face. Two machine 
learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes, were used within and across platforms to assess how they perform in classifying these six emotions. 

Results show that while SVM outperformed Naive Bayes in both single platform and cross platform classification, there were significant drops when the models were trained on one platform and tested on another. The findings of this project highlight the complicated 
linguistic and emotional differences that exist between Reddit and Twitter posts, which present challenges for cross-platform emotion classification. 

The findings suggest that cross-platform models could provide valuable insights into public mental health trends by capturing diverse emotional expressions across different online spaces. Practically, these models could assist mental health professionals, policymakers and 
researchers in developing more accurate tools for early detection of mental illnesses.
